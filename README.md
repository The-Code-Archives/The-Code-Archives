I'm a new programmer who has been investing his time in coding and seeking to build a career out of it. 
This Github page will be used to share code with others and receive code from others as well. 
This is a great website to archive coding projects and share it with others who would like code. 
Any tips, resources, or help is appreciated in helping me build my career.
